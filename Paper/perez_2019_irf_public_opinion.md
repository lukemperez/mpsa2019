	’The International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (IRFA) provides the U.S. government with additional tools and information in order to promote the rights of religious minorities around the world. In addition to mandating annual reporting from the State Department, the law created an independent watchdog agency to monitor religious freedom around the world and provides the executive with additional sanction powers for states which abuse religious minorities. Little is known, however, about the scope and intensity of American knowledge and support for these policies. This paper investigates the contours of American public opinion on international religious freedom. It relies on data from the 2018 CCES survey and attempts to identify the level of support for international religious freedom among the American electorate. 
	But little is known about American attitudes about the law or subsequent policies which seek to strengthen rights of religious minorities around the world. This paper investigates public support for International Religious Freedom with questions on the 2018 CCES.

# Introduction

In 1998, Congress past the International Religious Freedom Act, by overwhelming margins, which established the protection of religious minorities as a core objective of American foreign policy. Since its passage the law has been modified several times, including as recently as 2016 when a Republican controlled Congress passed (and a Democratic president signed) modifications to include Atheism as one of the protected classes of religious belief and elevated the Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom reports directly to the Secretary of State. The provisions of IRFA include mandating that the State Department produce annual reporting on the status of religious freedom for every country in the world, and the US Commission on International Religious Freedom who is tasked, inter alia, with evaluating and critiquing the State Department's report from the previous year. The pace of promoting religious freedom abroad continues unabated. Last year, the State Department held the first ever ministerial, a high level diplomatic conference, on international religious freedom.

Explaining this behavior has, however, posed difficulty for researchers. These practices cannot explained as part of a general effort among developed nations to promote human rights. For although nearly every developed country in the world has an office of international human rights, only the United States has both IRFA and a human rights office. Nor can these practices be explained as part of America's pre-occupation with religion. Religious belief has been on the decline for decades [@jones2016:endwhitechristian]. The link between foreign policy and public opinion is also weak [@jacobs2005:whoinfluencesFP], though this link has yet to be tested on human rights and religious freedom.

This paper beings to explore the link between public knowledge and support for international religious freedom and the activities of the US government which promote this particular human right with exceptional energy. Drawing on a unique data set of questions on the 2018 Cooperative Congressional Election Survey (CCES). The questions test for political knowledge about foreign policy before investigating the attitudes of voters on issues of international religious freedom.

# Literature Review
## Political Development of Grand Strategy


## Political opinions toward International Religious Freedom
Given the above development of international religious freedom, it remains an open question whether and to what extend voters are knowledgeable of and supportive of international religious freedom. International relations scholars who investigate foreign policy have speculated several different causal pathways for individual voter preference. 

> Studies which assert no connection between public opinion and policy run counter to the findings of international relations scholars who find democracies are unique actors which are often constrained or enabled by the the people who make up the democratic polity. Snyder (1991) argues that democracies are more war prone because the general public often misunderstands how security is achieved, preferring empire when defensive posture would be more stable. Trubowitz (1998) finds that competition between regions within the United States created three blocs; competition and bargaining between these blocs attributed to distinct foreign policy designs. These regional blocs were animated by the interests of the general public and fought by the congressional representatives who elected them. Wagner (2007) argues that international relations is largely a function of bargaining models, not only between states, but between elites within a state and between elites and the masses within a state. These claims imply that publics do, contrary to the above claims, have at least some loose connection which permits them to influence policy outcomes. 

#. Work in public opinion finds a weak link between the general public and elite decision making [@jacobs2005:whoinfluencesFP]. Foreign policy decision-making tracks more closely with elite and business opinion.
#. Work in international relations generally finds a tighter link between general public and decision-making, although the findings tend to be focused on war and national security [@snyder2013:myths].
#. Religion may work differently than economics and war since religion has potential to organize stronger social than other values and can, under certain conditions, compete with politics [@snyder2011:religIR, 3]. <!-- Not just "omitted variable" -->
#. During the Cold War, e.g., elites relied on religion and religious freedom rhetoric to mobilize national support for containment [@inboden2008:soulcontainment @herzog2011:spiritualindustrial].
#. After the Cold War, the passage of IRFA was driven predominately by both secular and religious human rights activists [@hertzke2004:freeinggodschildren].

# Data

I have original questions added to the CCES 2018. Sample Size, 1000; nationally representative; 

# Analysis
#. Given the widespread support of IRF policies, we ought hypothesize that support for IRF is widespread across the ideologial spectrum.

# Discussion

# Conclusion

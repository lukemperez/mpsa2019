CC18_422b                     Racism - Racial problems in the U.S. are rare,

CC18_422f                     Racial Resentment -- Generations of slavery and 
                              discrimination have created conditions that make

                              the lower class.

                              only try harder they could be just as well off as 
                              whites.

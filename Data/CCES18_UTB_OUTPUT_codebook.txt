CC18_422b                     Racism - Racial problems in the U.S. are rare,

CC18_422f                     Racial Resentment -- Generations of slavery and 
                              discrimination have created conditions that make 
                              it difficult for blacks to work their way out of 
                              the lower class.

                              only try harder they could be just as well off as 
                              whites.
